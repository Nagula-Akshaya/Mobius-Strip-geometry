# Mobius Strip Surface Visualization & Analysis

This Python project generates and visualizes a 3D Möbius strip using parametric equations, and numerically approximates its surface area and edge length.

## Code Structure

The entire logic is encapsulated in a `MobiusStrip` class for clarity and reusability:

- **`__init__`**: Initializes parameters like radius (`R`), strip width (`w`), and mesh resolution (`n`). It creates a 2D grid of parameters `u` and `v`.
- **`_generate_mesh()`**: Uses parametric equations to generate 3D coordinates `(x, y, z)` for the Mobius surface.
- **`surface_area()`**: Approximates the total surface area using vector calculus and numerical integration.
- **`edge_length()`**: Computes the total length of the Möbius boundary.
- **`plot()`**: Visualizes the strip in 3D using `matplotlib`.

## Surface Area Approximation

To approximate the surface area:

1. **Partial Derivatives**: Calculated derivatives of the 3D surface coordinates with respect to the parametric variables `u` and `v`.
2. **Cross Product**: Computed the cross product of these vectors to find the infinitesimal surface normal.
3. **Magnitude (dA)**: The magnitude of this normal vector gives the local area element.
4. **Numerical Integration**: Used `scipy.integrate.simpson` to perform 2D Simpson’s rule integration over the `(u, v)` parameter grid.

## Challenges Faced

- **Gradient Accuracy**: Ensuring stable, smooth derivatives required careful resolution tuning (`n` value).
- **Method Redundancy**: Initial code had duplicate `surface_area` methods, which was corrected for clarity and correctness.
- **Boundary Complexity**: Approximating the Mobius strip’s edge required careful traversal and understanding of its single-twisted boundary, which loops over itself.
